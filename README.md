## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for developing a web-based crane maintenance and inspection management software. The system aims to digitize and automate the entire lifecycle of crane maintenance operations, from asset registration to reporting, while providing role-specific access to administrators, technicians, operators, and customers.

### Purpose
The purpose of this software is to streamline crane maintenance operations, ensure regulatory compliance, improve safety, reduce downtime, and provide a centralized platform for all stakeholders involved in crane operations and maintenance.

### Scope
The system will cover the following key areas:
- Crane asset registration and lifecycle management
- Scheduling and documentation of inspections
- Digital operator logbooks for daily checks
- Work order creation and management
- Spare parts inventory tracking
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics

## System Overview

The Crane Maintenance & Inspection Management Software will be a web-based application accessible through standard web browsers. It will provide different interfaces for administrators, technicians, operators, and customers, each tailored to their specific needs and responsibilities.

### High-Level Process Flow

1. **Asset Registration & Management**: Cranes and components are registered in the system with detailed specifications.
2. **Inspection Scheduling & Reporting**: Regular inspections are scheduled, conducted, and documented.
3. **Work Order Generation**: Issues identified during inspections or reported by operators are converted into work orders.
